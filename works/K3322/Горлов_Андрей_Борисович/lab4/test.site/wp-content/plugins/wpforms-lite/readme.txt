= Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder =

Create custom contact forms in minutes with our easy-to-use [drag and drop online form builder](https://wpforms.com/features/drag-drop-online-form-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin). But don't just take our word for it. See what WordPress experts are saying:

> WPForms is by far the <strong>easiest form plugin to use</strong>. My clients love WPForms and it's one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br>
> Bill Erickson - Expert WordPress Consultant

= Pre-built Form Templates =

WPForms comes with [2000+ pre-built form templates](https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin).

Whether you're looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, Stripe payment form, or a subscription form, we have a form template already prepared and ready to use.

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly, and Optimized for Speed =

WPForms contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly. We optimized every query on the frontend and the backend to ensure that it's one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugins.

You can embed your contact form on any page with an optimized title and description, so WPForms is one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugins too.

= Fields & Features You Need to Succeed =

With star ratings, file uploads, repeater fields, survey fields, and multi-page contact forms, you can easily build the right custom form for your site's needs. Plus, integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service in just a few steps and collect payments with Stripe, PayPal, and Square for bookings and orders without the need for a dedicated eCommerce plugin.

See what one business owner has to say about their WPForms contact form:

>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allows me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>
> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN

= Surveys & Polls =

Create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey. Our [WordPress survey plugin addon](https://wpforms.com/features/surveys-and-polls-addon?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin) comes with smart survey fields including Likert scale, star ratings, and NPS. Embed your surveys and polls anywhere in WordPress.

Use our survey reporting tools to customize graphs, export them for presentations, and display aggregate results. You can also share poll results instantly when collecting votes.

= Default WordPress Forms =

Aside from building simple contact forms, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms, like custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms. Create a password-protected contact form or even a members-only contact form.

Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials, and more.

= Payment Forms, Donation Forms, Booking Forms, and More =

While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution for any type of payment or booking form.

WPForms integrates with PayPal, Stripe, Square Payments, and Authorize.Net so you can easily accept credit card payments or take payments via PayPal. Bonus: you can also take signatures.

We're proud to be a Stripe Verified Partner. This partnership allows us to build the best Stripe integration with early access to features. You can use our Stripe integration to accept both one-time payments as well as recurring payments while syncing all form data to your Stripe account.

= Custom Calculator Forms =

Using the [WPForms Calculations addon](https://wpforms.com/features/calculations-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin), you can build custom formulas and display results on the frontend.

Create simple arithmetic calculations or build complex conditional calculations with rounded values, averages, time ranges, and more! It's the best calculator plugin for WordPress.

= Forms Optimized for Conversions =

With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages to increase conversions.

To improve form completion rates, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your feedback forms feel more human by adding an interactive layout. ([See Conversational Forms Demo](https://wpforms.com/features/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin)).

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and CSS. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier thanks to our native integrations.

We also know that our developer friends may want more control, so we added tons of hooks and filters.
